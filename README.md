Personal repository related to releases of the ArtContracts project

## What is ArtContracts?
ArtContracts is a personal project of mine, first announced on 2021/06/03 via [**this Twitter thread**](https://twitter.com/mathMakesArt/status/1400404617138257921) and [**this prototype NFT**](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/112092) on [**HicEtNunc**](https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc).
The goal is to facilitate the storage of art (and other arbitrary data) entirely on-chain, specifically within the [**Tezos**](https://github.com/tezos) blockchain.
